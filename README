To develop in DEV mode >> refactor java package to "grocerieDev"
change application ID to grocerieDev
change app label in manifest
maybe rebuild or invalidate/restart

do the same steps but with "grocerie" to make changes to daily-use app

ingredient provider now uses buildConfig.APPLICATION_ID as its authority
